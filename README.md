# What is Data Analysis?
Data Analysis is the technique to collect, transform, and organize data to make future predictions, and make informed data-driven decisions. It also helps to find possible solutions for a business problem. There are six steps for Data Analysis. They are:

Ask or Specify Data Requirements
Prepare or Collect Data
Clean and Process
Analyze
Share
Act or Report
Each step has its own process and tools to make overall conclusions based on the data.
